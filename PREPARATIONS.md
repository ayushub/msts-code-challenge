# Preparations (Code Challenge)

The code challenge will see you extending a small web application with a set of new features. Therefore you need to be familiar with `JavaScript`, `node.js` and the `SQL` (the `Postgres` flavour.)

If you have no experience with `docker`, containers and `docker-compose` prior we suggest you install `docker` on your machine and prior to taking on the challenge. 
You can finish the challenge without using `docker` but it will save you time and make your work easier. There is a section in `TIPS.md` how you run the local environment without it.

The backend code you will be extending is built on `node.js` the following NPM packages:

* `express` - minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework
* `node-fetch` - A light-weight module that brings `window.fetch` to `node.js`.
* `pg` - PostgreSQL client for node (https://node-postgres.com/)

The frontend code is built with standard `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` without any external packages / dependencies.

This information is just for you get prepared for the tech stack used in the code base you will work on. 

You will have the option to replace and introduce any frameworks / libraries with whatever you choose if that makes your work easier (you may even replace the database if you want to.) 

If you don't have a `SQL` client for adhoc queries installed on your machine that supports `Postgres` there is a open source client https://dbeaver.io/ which we recommend you installing prior to beginning the challenge.
